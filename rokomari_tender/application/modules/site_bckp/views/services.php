                    <strong>Locality/Area Based:</strong> This is applicable when your business activities are concentrated on particular area say, Barisal and Bhola only. In such case, you will only receive tender notifications related to either of these areas only.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Auction/Lease/Sale Based:</strong> This is applicable when you want to receive only auction/lease/sale related tenders.
