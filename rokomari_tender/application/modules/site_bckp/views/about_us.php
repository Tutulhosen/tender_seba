                    In Bangladesh, where public procurement constructs almost 20% of national GDP, a portal like RokomariTender acts as a great entrepreneurial initiative to strengthen governmentâ€™s efforts to bring transparency in all the processes required to complete the huge operations of procurement. As Bangladesh advances more towards its potentials to be one of the bigger players on the globe (it has been cited as one of the Next-11 among the most promising economies after BRIC-Brazil, Russia, India & China by Goldman Sachs), the need to introduce and maintain transparency becomes critical. Government of Bangladesh is currently working towards implementing an Electronic Procurement system, widely known as e-GP. At RokomariTender we strongly believe that being a forerunner on the front our contributions will be invaluable because we know how every opportunity counts.
